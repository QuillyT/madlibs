... because I don't have many instructions on the site I will put them here.

1.  Create an account.
2.  You may then click random or select to start a game. 

And there you go! 

* Random will start a game with a random user. 
* Select will open a modal that lists out all the existing users.
* Finished games will be under old games.
* Unfinished games will be on top.
* Games polled so updates happen every 3 or 5 seconds.
* When a game is open, it constantly refreshes as well. So if it isn't your turn to go, it will refresh every 3 seconds.

So just... a heads up. This is the first time I've worked with MySQL and php.
