... because I don't have many instructions on the site I will put them here.

1.  Create an account.
2.  You may then click random or select to start a game. 

And there you go! 

* The "Random" button will start a game with a random user. 
* The "Select" button will open a modal that lists out all the existing users for you to start a game with.
* Finished games will be under old games.
* Unfinished games will be on top.
* Game Lists poll. Updates happen every 5 seconds.
* When a game is open, it updates as well. So if it isn't your turn to go, it will poll every 3 seconds.
* If a game is highlighted, it is your turn to go in that game.

So just... a heads up. This is the first time I've worked with MySQL and php.
